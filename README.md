# PythonConferenceWebsite
**Technologies Used**
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, Jinja2, Python, SQLite

## About the Project
In my Web and Database course for my CS degree, I had to convert my HTML conference website to a Flask application using Python and Jinja2 for the templates.  
Most of the functionality from that HTML website remains with added functionality such as adding registered users into a SQLite database and login/logout
functionality using sessions to handle server-side user sessions.
